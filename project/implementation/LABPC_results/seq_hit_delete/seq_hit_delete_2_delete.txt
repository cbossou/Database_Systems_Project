32:[2018-03-18 06:28:17] <fatal> Autocorrelation coefficient (AC) limit (0.8) cannot be met. This means
that your data has high autocorrelation and is unlikely i.i.d. See
https://docs.ascar.io/features/autocorrelation-detection-and-mitigation.html for a
detailed explanation. You should check the source of the data and try to reduce the
autocorrelation among samples. You can also set a higher AC limit (using --ac) to
bypass this limit.
