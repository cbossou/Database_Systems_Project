\section{Overview}

This document was created to attempt to address major concerns brought about by
Professor Shel Finkelstein regarding my CMPS 278 course paper and presentation.

\section{Paper/General}

\subsection{Main goal (for Level A of course project) was to determine where
  RocksDB is good; did I achieve that? What did I conclude? Were these the
right experiments?}

\subsection{Tests were confusing}

\subsubsection{Why did I focus on average value for data.}

\subsubsection{In most real applications, the key that is searched for is usually
  found, yet I had much higher misses than usual because of the way data was
generated.}

\subsubsection{My data generation led to update not being meaningful, which is
unfortunate.}


\subsubsection{Did I consider range queries?}


\subsection{Do you think that your results would be the same if you had more
data and a larger system?}

\subsubsection{How do you results compare with RocksDB tests by others?}


\subsubsection{I agree with you that time for delete should not be that poor,
  and I think that others have not had this problem.  Any idea why your delete
was slow?}

\subsection{Why did you show weird cases in presentation, when you had 72
  different graphs?  Weren't you able to draw conclusions from "less weird"
cases.}


\subsection{Feels like RocksDB would be unusable in practice, given some of your
results.  But it's definitely usable in practice, so what's going on?}

\subsubsection{Futures make a lot of sense for RocksDB, but the most important
  objective would be to have realistic tests on a well-configured environment
  with meaningful conclusions, and I'm not sure that was achieved. What do you
think?}

\section{Presentation}

As a side note, ASCAR is a company started by a recent PhD graduate of the SSRC,
not to be confused by the numerous other things that it also apparently refers
to.

\subsection{Should get be faster when data isn't there?}

%When data isn't there, you have to look in all levels (unless you have Bloom filters--did you?).  And if it is there, you can stop when you find it.

\subsection{Operational issues of interest}

\subsubsection{Ran for 4 hours on both computers, 32,768. Stuck on one step up.}

\subsubsection{One core was pegged at 100\%, others at 20-30\%}

\subsubsection{Home desktop was better with only cpu usage 10\%, but wasnâ€™t that
much faster}

%probably because single-threaded. Is it possible (or desirable) to use RocksDB with multi-threading?
